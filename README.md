# KlantaLauncher
Very lightweight Minecraft game launcher with skin system, .mrpack/custom mod pack installer and very simple interface.<br />
## Why should you use this?<br />
1. Very lightweight<br />
For example, our launcher "eats" less ~100mb of RAM. Launcher's interface is very simple, I think, it will be understandable even to a small child<br />
2. Modpacks installer<br />
You can install .mrpack modpacks in a few clicks! Or if you don't want to use .mrpack, you can build your own modpack with .zip.<br />_For example, you want to play Minecraft with mods with friends! You can make a .zip modpack and others can just drug and drop it into launcher to install_<br />
3. Skin system<br />
Our launcher uses Ely.by skin system. You can change your skin in a few clicks!<br />
